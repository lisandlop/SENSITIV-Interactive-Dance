# SENSITIV – Interactive Dance Performance tool

An interactive dance tool coded in Max/MSP, where the co-play between a dancer and musician while introducing technology is explored. 

Making use of a drum set using Sensory Percussion (Sunhouse) sensors, and NGIMU (x-io Technologies) wearable motion sensors. 

This tool lets the dancer in real-time control the sound produced by the drummer. 

Coded by Lisa Andersson López & Thelma Svenns. 
In collaboration with musician Jakob Klang and dancer and choreographer Isabell Hertzberg.
