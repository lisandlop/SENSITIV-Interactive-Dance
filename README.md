# SENSITIV – Interactive Dance Performance tool

An interactive dance tool coded in Max/MSP, where the co-play between a dancer and musician while introducing technology is explored. 

Making use of a drum set using Sensory Percussion (Sunhouse) sensors, and NGIMU (x-io Technologies) wearable motion sensors. 

This tool lets the dancer in real-time control the sound produced by the drummer. 

Coded by Lisa Andersson López & Thelma Svenns. 
In collaboration with musician Jakob Klang and dancer and choreographer Isabell Hertzberg.

2. Configure NGIMU sensors to computer and wi-fi
3. Set up Sensory Percussion (train sensors/software); connect to computer through sound card 
4. Turn on NGIMU sensors -> dance and control the music (delay and pitch)!
